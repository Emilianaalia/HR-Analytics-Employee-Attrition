This project aims to analyze the factors that affect employee attrition, which is when an employee decides to leave the company. Dataset describes employee characteristics such as age, role job, job satisfaction, monthly income, years at the company, work life balance, and overtime. This dataset using both supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Supervised Learning 
Supervised learning, to predict employee attrition status using confusion matrix model evaluation to show that the model is able to classify most of the data correctly despite some prediction errors.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning uses the K-Means clustering method to group employees based on characteristics such as age and monthly income. The number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, which shows that the optimal number of clusters is 3. This shows that employees are grouped according to different age and income characteristics.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project shows that the application of machine learning can help in understanding employee data. Supervised learning functions to make predictions, while unsupervised learning functions to find hidden patterns and segmentation in the data. These two applications complement each other and provide insight into employee attrition analysis.
